# bucketListTracker
The Bucket List Tracker is a simple yet interactive web application designed to help users organize, manage, and track their personal goals in an intuitive way. The project is built using HTML for structure, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for functionality, with a strong focus on DOM manipulation to create a smooth and responsive user experience. The main objective of this application is to demonstrate how core front-end technologies can be combined to build a practical, user-friendly tool without relying on external frameworks or libraries.

The application allows users to add new bucket list items through an input field, which are then dynamically displayed on the screen. Each item comes with options to mark it as completed or remove it from the list, enabling users to easily manage their goals. All interactions happen in real time, meaning changes are immediately reflected on the page without the need for reloads. Tailwind CSS is used extensively to create a clean, modern, and responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across both desktop and mobile devices.

From a technical perspective, the project highlights important JavaScript concepts such as event handling, dynamic element creation, conditional styling, and efficient DOM updates. The code is structured to keep logic clear and maintainable, making the project easy to understand and extend. Overall, the Bucket List Tracker serves as a practical example of front-end development fundamentals and is well suited for beginners looking to strengthen their skills, as well as for showcasing basic UI design and JavaScript proficiency in a portfolio or academic submission.
